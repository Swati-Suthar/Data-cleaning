Nashville Housing dataset is used for data cleaning process in sql_
Done with the help of youtube resources and kaggle datasets available_
I found it personally advanced and learning each day because data cleaning is a major part of an analyst_
Divided into different parts: Firstly started with standardizing the dates, then populated the address because the address seemed too complicated with states and cities_There is use of case statements to convert a few abbreviate into proper words_Lastly removed dublicates by writing queries and then putting into CTE_ Then removed unused columns as well_I have a lot to learn and with practice I will ace this process someday
